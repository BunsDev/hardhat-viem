# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat-viem use case. Scripts to read, write and listen to events of a contract and testing.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
